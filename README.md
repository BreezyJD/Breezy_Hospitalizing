# Breezy_Hospitalizing


## What is it?

This script is a remake of Badger's famous Jailing script. Instead of doing /jail &lt;id> &lt;reason> and being sent to prison/jail, you will do /hospitalize &lt;id> &lt;reason> and you will be sent to Paleto's medical center instead. 



## Commands

`/hospitalize <id> <time>` - Requires `Breezy_Hospitalize.Jail` permission. 

`/release <id>` - Requires `Breezy_Hospitalize.Unjail` permission.


## Configuration
```
Config = {
    Prefix = '^1[^5Breezy Hospitalizing^1] ^3',
    PrisonExit = { x = -247.6, y = 6331.74, z = 33.43 },
    Cells = {
        ['Cell 1'] = { x = -261.59, y = 6319.62, z = 33.44 }, -- 1
        ['Cell 2'] = { x = -258.94, y = 6316.8, z = 33.44 }, -- 2
        ['Cell 3'] = { x = -259.3, y = 6309.8, z = 33.44 }, -- 3
